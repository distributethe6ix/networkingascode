# Networking as Code
An approach and perspective to Networking-As-Code.

![](../assets/the_new_network_stack.png)

In this repo, our main focus is building a simple architecture that allows us to use Python, YAML, and Bash (to an extent) to configure the following:

1. Bare metal switches and routers
2. Bare metal servers
3. The operating system layer
4. The virtualization and SDN layer
5. The container runtime
6. The container orchestration layer
7. The container networking interface
8. The API Gateway, Ingress, and Service Mesh Layer

This repo will be continually built out with more structure.
